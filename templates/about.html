    <h2>Background &amp; Journey</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Hyderabad, India with a fascination for how business decisions ripple through technology stacks. That curiosity brought me to BITS Pilani, where I mixed electronics with computing and discovered how distributed systems keep organizations running. After internships with teams at Amazon and Crossbar Talent, I saw first-hand how disciplined engineering and well-designed processes improve resilience and clarity for both developers and end users.</p>

    <h2>Interests &amp; Goals</h2>
    <p>Today I’m immersed in the MSIS program at Kelley, blending consulting frameworks with hands-on tech work. I’m most energized by cyber security and the human side of platform engineering—bringing cross-functional teams together so systems stay reliable even under pressure. Outside of campus, you’ll find me unwinding with chess tactics, meal-prepping new recipes, or reading up on sports analytics.</p>
    <p>Over the next few years my goal is to join a consulting or product team where I can architect dependable cloud systems, guide stakeholders through security-minded decisions, and mentor teammates as we iterate. Long term, I see myself leading large-scale digital transformations that keep accessibility, trust, and measurable business value at the center.</p>
